# S4S LinkedIn Lead Generation Tool

## New Streaming Analysis Feature

This extension now supports **real-time streaming analysis** of LinkedIn posts during scrolling, providing a much more efficient workflow for lead generation.

### How It Works

1. **Start Scrolling & Analysis**: Click this button to begin scrolling LinkedIn and analyzing posts in real-time
2. **Real-time Processing**: As LinkedIn loads new posts during scrolling, each post is immediately:
   - Sent to Ollama to determine if it's a hiring post
   - If it's a lead, extracts the author's title and company
   - Adds it to the results immediately
3. **Live Metrics**: Watch real-time statistics including:
   - Posts Found: Total number of posts discovered
   - Posts Analyzed: Number of posts sent to Ollama
   - Leads Found: Number of hiring posts identified
   - Analysis Status: Current state (Scrolling & Analyzing, Analyzing Remaining, Complete)
4. **Continuous Analysis**: After stopping scrolling, analysis continues until all posts are processed
5. **Stop Scrolling**: Click to stop scrolling but continue analyzing remaining posts
6. **Download Leads as CSV**: Export all found leads to a CSV file

### Benefits of Streaming Analysis

- **Faster Results**: No need to wait for all posts to load before analysis begins
- **Real-time Feedback**: See leads being found as you scroll with live metrics
- **Better Performance**: Processes posts as they're discovered rather than in large batches
- **Continuous Processing**: Analysis continues after scrolling stops until all posts are processed
- **Immediate CSV Export**: Download results as soon as analysis completes

### Live Metrics Display

The extension now shows live metrics during analysis:
- **Posts Found**: Total posts discovered on the page
- **Posts Analyzed**: Posts that have been sent to Ollama for analysis
- **Leads Found**: Hiring posts that have been identified and enriched with title/company data
- **Analysis Status**: 
  - "Scrolling & Analyzing": Active scrolling and analysis
  - "Analyzing Remaining": Scrolling stopped, continuing to analyze remaining posts
  - "Complete": All posts have been analyzed

### Requirements

- Ollama running locally on port 11435
- A model like `gemma3:12b` installed in Ollama
- LinkedIn page open in a browser tab

### Usage

1. Open LinkedIn and navigate to your feed
2. Click "Start Scrolling & Analysis"
3. Watch the live metrics as the extension scrolls LinkedIn and analyzes posts in real-time
4. Click "Stop Scrolling" when you want to stop scrolling (analysis continues)
5. Wait for analysis to complete (status will show "Complete")
6. Click "Download Leads as CSV" to export results

The extension automatically saves leads to browser storage, so you can download them later even if you close the popup.
